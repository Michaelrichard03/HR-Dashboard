# Employee Data Analysis Project
This project involves analyzing employee data by pulling data from an Excel sheet and creating visualizations in Power BI. The analysis provides insights into gender distribution, staff roles, salary trends, and hiring patterns.

## Data Sources
   
Excel Dataset: Employee information such as Emp ID, Name, Gender, Education Qualification, Salary, Job Title, Age, and Date of Joining.
Power BI Dashboard: Used for data visualization.
## Steps Involved
### Data Preparation
Extract Data: Import the Excel file containing employee details.
Clean Data: Handle missing values, standardize text fields, and format salary and age columns.
Transform Data: Create calculated columns and measures (e.g., Average Salary, Leave Balance, Headcount).
### Data Visualization in Power BI
Gender Distribution:
